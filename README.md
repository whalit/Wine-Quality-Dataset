# Wine-Quality-Dataset

This is a multi-class classification problem. 

In this work we analyse two datasets on wine quality available from the UCI machine learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).

The classes are not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones)

The file winequality.names contains relevent information about the dataset and the attributes.
